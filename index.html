        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to the Piscina Pergola app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Luca Gentili (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
            <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>
<p>The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.</p>
  <p>Guest Access: The Application allows users to browse course lists, schedules, and general information as a "Guest" without the need to register, log in, or provide any personally identifiable information. Personal data is only collected when you voluntarily choose to create an account to access specific features, such as booking a course.

<p>Personal Information: For a better experience, specifically when you decide to register and book courses, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to email, first name, last name, token fcm, and platform.</p>
<p>Optional Data (Gender): You may voluntarily choose to provide your gender. This information is optional and is requested solely for the purpose of customizing your user profile avatar within the Application. If you choose not to provide this information (by selecting "Prefer not to say"), a generic avatar will be assigned to your profile. This data is not required for the Application to function.</p>       
        <h3>Third Party Access</h3>
        <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
        <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
